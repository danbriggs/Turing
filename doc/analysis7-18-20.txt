I am looking at record.txt right now
(which I've included; it's also linked at https://web.archive.org/web/20121026023118/http://web.mit.edu/~dbriggs/www/ in Turing72410.zip).

In it, I was alleging that #s 2, 5, 6, 18, and 25 have linear growth and that I'd proved they never halt;
by "linear growth" I mean that the total swath of tape accessed by the machine grows linearly as a function of the number of steps.
Let me make sure that Big Stretch Tape Test 2 in my new program isn't inconsistent with that.

The above lists, which I call "spectra," are sequences of numbers of steps between one phase when the machine is pushing the boundary of what it's accessed
and the next phase when it's pushing the boundary of what it's accessed again; this is different from Skelet's "spectrum".

#2's spectrum clearly has a period of 45, and #5's is exactly the same, so I'll believe myself there.
#6 is clearly doing the same thing, with a period of some number of steps before its action matches up with theirs, or vice versa.
#18's spectrum seems to have a period of 5 and #25's a period of 13. So I'll believe myself there.

Next, I was alleging that #s 8, 11, 12, and 13 have square root growth and that I'd proved they never halt.
This would usually be because the machine is running over a swath of tape that's increasing in length with each lap,
adding more copies of the same sequence in between the "bookends."
Let me make sure that Big Stretch Tape Test 2 in my new program isn't inconsistent with that.

Using Differences[{a_1,...,a_n},1,2] in Mathematica, it's a repeating pattern,
so I am convinced that what I said about #8 and #11 is true. #12 looks a little rougher, so I should extend it:

It seems #12's spectrum is comprised of sequences of length 24, in any spot 0 (mod 3) being 3,
in any spot 1 (mod 3) increasing by 4 every 6, in any spot 2 (mod 6) adding 16 & 20 alternately,
in any spot 5 (mod 12) adding 68 every first 12, and 64 every other 12.
In fact, using Mathematica to look at finite differences in this list spaced various numbers of terms apart,
it seems the finite difference method keeps going "almost all the way" toward explaining the pattern,
and then there are a few stragglers (positions 11 (mod 24) or one residue in an even higher modulus) left unexplained.
I'll have to look back at my proof for #12.


At least #13's spectrum is identical, so I believe what I wrote about proving the machines equivalent.

record.txt says that #9 and #10 have logarithmic growth; let's make sure Big Stretch Tape Test 2 isn't inconsistent with that.

#9's spectrum has the interesting numbers (spots 2 mod 3, starting with "6113") multiplied by 4 and adding a number that grows by 12s, starting with 89,
so I'll believe that what I wrote about that one is true.
#10's spectrum has the interesting numbers (spots 1 mod 2) multiplied by a ratio approaching the golden ratio,
so I'll believe that what I wrote about that one is true too.

I've pushed a version of the project where you can run Big Stretch Tape Test 2 in the same way;
just don't hit "Run" with such huge numbers or it'll just run out of memory allocating tape and/or freeze trying to print so much.
