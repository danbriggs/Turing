OOPS!
In the new numbering, BL_2 is #27;
in the old numbering in 2010; what is here #28 was #27.
So everything after 26 is offset by one!

CHANGELOG(7/19/20):
changed lin& to sqrt for #31, wrote "trivial"
deleted "cbrt" from 28
added $, ~, ~~, and == footnotes
added progress for 28 and 39; 24 and 38; 42; 41
changed progress from "not too hard" to "proved$ =23" for #29
added BL_2 row
deleted log and sqrt# from "type" for #23 and #29
added "proved by univerz" for #21, #31, #32
wrote this changelog
--------------------------------
* 4 has log complexity.
# 23 has fourth-root complexity.
& 30 has a small piece of increasing numbers of 1s on the left end.
$ details forthcoming.
== equivalent with an offset.
~ very similar type of action.
~~ almost identical stepwise.
--------------------------------
11 is very similar to 8. 12 is different, increasing the number of components each time.
10 is very similar to 9 (cross-referencing).
17 is sqrt on the left, log on the right.
7 is equivalent to 3 except for starting in different situations.
26 is equivalent to 15 except for starting in different situations.
15,26,32,33,34 are almost exactly the same.
29 uses 11110s.
35 has a log piece and phases.
36 peppers the tape with 10s.
37 uses 1100s; so does 41.
28 has the same action on the right-hand side as 3, 7.
NOTE: The BL_2 machine from subset dm_2 is also an HNR.

STATUS:
A total of 18 out of the 43 machines have been knocked out
(although a few, by simple machine isomorphisms, are forthcoming).

Of those that remain,
machine #16, 24, 38 will undoubtedly be resolved by nearly identical proofs;
machine #19, 42 will undoubtedly be resolved by nearly identical proofs;
machine #3, 7 will very likely be resolved by nearly identical proofs.

So I would say we likely have 21 essentially distinct proofs left to write.
Of the proofs that I wrote, I would say the most important one to verify is the proof for #12;
it is the most involved.
