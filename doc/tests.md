normalActionTest() simply creates a blank tape of length 2x+1, where x is "end step," puts the tape head in the middle, and runs it for x steps. It begins printing out the machine's state and (trimmed) tape from "start step." It returns false only if there is an exception, such as an index out of bounds exception.

yieldsTest() is supposed to verify that for a given pair of identical machines acting on a Configuration, if one machine acts on it for a certain number of steps, and then hands it off to the other, which acts for another number of steps (let's use start and stop for the numbers), then yields() returns true with that machine and the sum as parameters. (Acting on a Configuration is different from acting on a Tape in that a Configuration has a state whereas a Tape does not; when acting on a Tape, the machine's state is used, whereas when acting on a Configuration, the Configuration's state is used.) As it is now, though, it only verifies that no exceptions are thrown; it should be changed to verify that yields() returns true when it shouldâ€”and false when it should; this is trickier, since a Configuration *could* conceivably repeat; so let's use an odd number of steps (such as one more) to verify the "false" condition.

termTest() is *supposed* to verify that a condensed tape can be output in abbreviated and expanded form, and that the forms correspond. But the checking that the two outputs represent the same tape hasn't been written yet.

termfigurationTest() is supposed to verify that a given Termfiguration can be evaluated at a given integer n, and the result makes sense. But the checking that the output makes sense hasn't been automated yet.

configurationReadTest() verifies that configurations can be read in from strings. As it is now, I've hard-coded two strings representing HNR#1 working on a given tape 27 steps apart. So this could be easily replicated for all the other machines, but it might be smarter for us to have Tapes alongside Configurations and turn the Tapes into strings that should be read as Configurations; then, we wouldn't have to hard-code strings.

leftToRightInductionTest() and rightToLeftInductionTest() will take a lot of labor to generalize to 43 machines, since we need to identify a simple Lemma that we could write about each Machine that the program, in its current state, can prove. This is currently the cutting edge of what this program can accomplish, but it's very simple compared to what other people have been able to do.

Please read the code in leftToRightInductionTest(). In words, it says "Given Machine Skelet's HNR#1, (011)^(9+n) with tape head at index 0 in state C yields (110)^(9+n) with tape head at index 27+3n (i.e., off the right edge) in state C in 27+3n steps." Then it proves that by induction. So we would look for similar statements for the other 42 machines.

successorTest() should be before the induction tests, since it's just for verifying that the successor operation on Termfigurations is working properly. As it is now, though, we haven't automated the verification yet.

lemmaAsStringTest() tests whether Lemmas can be output as strings. Maybe it would be a good idea to crawl through the String and make sure certain substrings show up, but we can put this on the back-burner.

condensedConfigurationTest() is supposed to verify that a condensed configuration expands properly. But I neglected to return a boolean accordingly so far. So it is similar to termTest(), but just for CondensedConfiguration rather than CondensedTape.

actTest1() and actTest2() are on the cutting edge of the program; they verify that a LemmaList can be employed in the running of a Machine to accelerate it. But as it is now, they don't verify that any of the Lemmas were actually employed. It would probably be a good idea to modify the return value (integer) of Acceleration.act() to be something like the number of times a Lemma from the LemmaList was employed, and then have the test verify that Lemmas were employed the appropriate number of times (say, once for each machine for actTest1() and twice for each machine for actTest2()). But as you can see, it will be quite laborious to hard-code the testing machine by machine.

A StretchTape is different from a Tape in that it remembers the least and greatest indices that have either (1) nonzero bits or (2) been accessed by the tape head for it. A Tape runs fast by not having to check this; a StretchTape *prints* fast by not having to crawl through tons of zeros. stretchTapeTest() just makes sure no exceptions are thrown while running a machine on a StretchTape; but it would be a good idea to extend the test to square the results with those from running on a Tape, Configuration etc.

bigStretchTapeTest() ascertains how much bigger the stretch (max index minus min index, as in the previous paragraph) becomes as you run each Machine on a blank tape for certain large numbers of steps. bigStretchTapeTest2() determines how long the periods were in between the starts of those in which the tape was being "stretched" for each of its "stretching" intervals. bigStretchTapeTest2() is very good for getting what I would call the "spectrum" of each Machine; the more patterned the numbers, the more likely the Machine is to be easy to crack. I invite you to read the spectrum of each machine as it is output by bigStretchTapeTest2() and comment on which Machines seem like they would be easiest to write proofs of non-halting for.

Neither of these two tests has to be improved in any way; in fact, these two have been coded to run on the whole battery of machines already, so they only need to be adapted to be runnable on a single machine instead also; should be easy.
