• The number of 1s to the right of the 0 seems unable to affect
  the number of swaths.
• The number of 1s to the right of the 0 seems to have a more
  predictable and steady effect on the number of steps passed
  than the number of 1s to the left of the 0.
• The number of 1s to the right of the 0 seems to have either a
  constant, 2 for 2, or 2 for every other 2 effect on the
  number of 1s left left of the 0.
  Using C for constant, = for 2 for 2, / for 2 every other 2,
  here's how it goes based on the number of 1s on the left:
   0:/  2:=  4:/  6:C  8:C 10:C 12:/ 14:C 16:C 18:C 20:/ 22:C
  24:C 26:C 28:/ 30:C 32:C 34:C 36:/ 38:C 40:C 42:C 44:/ 46:C
  48:C 50:C 52:/ 54:C 56:C 58:C
  So it seems that for m >= 4 even, the rule is:
  we get / when m is 4 (mod 8), C when it's anything else.
