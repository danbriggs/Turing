The goal of this project is to write accelerations for highly non-regular five-state Turing machines with the aim of proving they don't halt or running them until they do.

Please see src/images/flowchart.png to learn the similarities and differences among the different classes.

The tests are in place to verify that extensions to the project aren't breaking its older functionality; read tests.md to learn the purposes of the tests and what needs to be added to them.
