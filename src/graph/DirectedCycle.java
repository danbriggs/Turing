/**
 *  The {@code DirectedCycle} class represents a data type for 
 *  determining whether a digraph has a directed cycle.
 *  The <em>hasCycle</em> operation determines whether the digraph has
 *  a simple directed cycle and, if so, the <em>cycle</em> operation
 *  returns one.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses depth-first search.
 *  The constructor takes &Theta;(<em>V</em> + <em>E</em>) time in the worst
 *  case, where <em>V</em> is the number of vertices and <em>E</em> is
 *  the number of edges.
 *  Each instance method takes &Theta;(1) time.
 *  It uses &Theta;(<em>V</em>) extra space (not including the digraph).
 *  <p>
 *  See {@link Topological} to compute a topological order if the
 *  digraph is acyclic.
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation,
 *  see <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42digraph">Section 4.2</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
