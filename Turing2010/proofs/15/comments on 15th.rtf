\f0\fs24 \cf0 This machine counts in binary in two different languages at the same time, one on the left and one on the right. The center bit becomes 0 when the tape head is to the left, and 1 when it is to the right, of the center bit. Unfortunately, when the machine loads up its full sequence (e.g., on the right) to reach the end of the accessed tape, the off-by-1 situation there causes the center to move 41 spaces left.\
\
Will investigate when this happens further, and by how much the tape head moves then.}
