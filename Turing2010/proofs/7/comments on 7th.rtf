\f0\fs24 \cf0 moves 00s on the left 4 to the left and 0s on the right 2 to the left. Then when the 00s get to the left side it moves over the 0 and turns it into 00. Then it works its way back towards the 00 in the same fashion, but when it gets to it it turns it into 000 and then 11. Moves over the 0 left on the right, turning it to 00. This time around, the two instances of 00 annihilate, the 11 becomes the new 00, and the 0 on the right left over becomes the new 0 used.\
